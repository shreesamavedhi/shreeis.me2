So it's been some time. These last few weeks, I've been able to think about what it's going to take me to actually stick to a regimen. I've also needed to ask myself what goals are worth pursing- which ones will I actually be driven and obsessive about. Here's a sample plan, breaking down large goals into manageable and measurable steps. 

The way I'm structuring this, it's like I'm taking a part time semester of "shree university". 

*Key*
MUS: Music
JB: Career Interview/Application/LinkedIn
DTA: Data Science Path
GMDV: Game Development
FT: Fitness
FLM: Film

**Monday**
- 4:30PM to 5:30PM: MUS200 (Drum Lesson)
- 7:00PM to 8:00PM: JB125 (Neetcode Lecture + Homework)

**Tuesday**
- 5:00PM to 6:00PM: DTA101 (Machine Learning Plus Lecture/Homework/Quiz)
- 7:00PM to 8:30PM: GMDV200 (Video Game Development. Includes coding, digital art, animation, etc.)

**Wednesday**
- 5:00PM to 6:00PM: JB125 (Neetcode Lecture + Homework)
- 7:00PM to 7:30PM: JB100 (Apply to 5 positions)

**Thursday**
- 5:00PM to 6:00PM: DTA101 (Machine Learning Plus Lecture/Homework/Quiz)
- 6:30PM to 8:30PM: FT220 (Group Climbing Discussion)

**Friday**
- 5:00PM to 6:30PM: MUS345 (Music Composition + Production Lessons/Project)

**Weekend**
- 1hr FLM342 (Writing and Filming Homework)
- 1.5hr FT221 (Supplementary Climbing)
- 1hr GMDV201 (Playing Video Games)

I'm going to stick by this plan for 6 months. If I want this to be sustainable, I need time to breathe after work, and breathe on the weekends. I need a way to track my progress, so I'll be counting "attendance" and self-assigning my grade for each "course" based on this. All I need to do to succeed is stick to this schedule. That is it.

Oh, and as a bonus of how I'll be tracking attendance: After each day of "lessons", I'll make a blog post here going over what I learned/accomplished. 

While this is perhaps the most cringe thing I've had to do for my goals, it's necessary. 

I have **5 years, 11 months, and 3 days.**
